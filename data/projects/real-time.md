### Overview

I conducted experiments with real-time data streaming, leveraging Kafka, Flink, and Spark. Using Confluent as the backbone and Python for API integrations, I explored building scalable workflows for ingesting and processing high-velocity data.

### Key Contributions

- Developed APIs for real-time data ingestion and transformation pipelines.
- Experimented with Flink for stream processing and Spark for distributed computation.
- Used Confluent to manage and monitor streaming workflows.

### Results

- Gained hands-on experience with real-time streaming architectures.
- Identified key configurations for optimizing data flows in high-scale environments.
