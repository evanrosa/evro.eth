### Overview

This project involved building predictive models for wine ratings using machine learning techniques. I focused on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to achieve high accuracy.

### Key Contributions

- Used Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn) to clean, analyze, and process data.
- Applied machine learning models, including Random Forest and Linear Regression.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning for enhanced model performance.

### Results

- Achieved an RMSE of 2.3 on the dataset.
- Provided insights into the relationship between price, region, and rating.
